## Motivation:

- Regional disparities in educational outcomes still persist 
- Financial resources have been intensified 
- Government of Indonesia implemented the rule of 20 percent budgeting for educational funds. 
- There are relative few studies that evaluate the role of spatial effects on the educational process.
- Lack of academic literature on educational development at the sub-national level in Indonesia. 

  
## Research Question:
- Does role of neighborhood effect exist in altering the educational outcomes between proximate provinces? 
- What are the significant variables affecting the educational outcomes across provinces?
- How is the magnitude of those variables and spill-over effects to the educational outcomes across provinces?

  
## Methods:

- Spatial autocorrelation (Moran's I and LISA)
- Spatial Panel Models (SAR,SEM,SAC,SDM region-fixed effect)

## Main Results:

1. **Significant Spatial Autocorrelation** at the province level. 

2. **Spatial model**
  
  - Spatial Durbin Model is the best specification model
  - Number of educational institutions and pupil-teacher ratio are two key factors affecting educational outcomes across provinces in Indonesia
  - Number of educational institutions (elementary school and senior high school) have indirect effect to the educational outcome.

3. **Policy Implication**

  - Increasing spatially better coordination and cooperation on educational development connectivity between local governments especially in the Eastern part and outer islands 
  - Improving educational infrastructures

# (5) Concluding Remarks

- **Inequality still matters**. Eastern part of Indonesia need to be the priority of educational development.

- The availability of educational institutions in each level and the pupil-teacher ratio are vital factors to improve the educational outcomes in Indonesia.

- **Spill-over effect does exist**. The indirect effect of availability of schools to the mean years of schooling and expected years of schooling is positive and significant.
